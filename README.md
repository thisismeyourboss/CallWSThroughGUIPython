# CallWSThroughGUIPython
This is very useful Graphic user interface program, where using  a button in the tkinter GUI you can call a WS.
Note: Library necessary     : Requests (install it from pip)

In this piece of python program you can find three very important concepts and how use them:
- StringVar -> for binding variable to a Tkinker object (https://effbot.org/tkinterbook/variable.htm)
- lambda function -> to attach a method to a GUI Button
- requests -> how do a call to a WS

..of course, for correctly use the program you have to start before the SumWebService and when it is running, you can start the Main.py

Enjoy:)
